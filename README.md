- 👋 Hi, I’m @aaron-patton
- 👀 I’m interested in learning mostly. I kind of fell into coding SQL with my career in Logistics. I have since gone back to school for computer science and have found a great appreciation for coding in general. I really enjoy the problem solving and artistic freedom in doing so. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Javascript. 
- 🫱🏼‍🫲🏾 I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything really. I'd just like more real-world opportunities to practice.
